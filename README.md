# LeNet5-CIFAR10-Keras-Visualizer

Implementation of the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network architecture using Keras APIs for the CIFAR-10 dataset. LeNet-5 is a classic CNN architecture designed for handwritten digit recognition but can be adapted for various image classification tasks.

## Description

This repository contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the LeNet-5 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The code includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, model compilation, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Implementation of LeNet-5 architecture using Keras
- Data preprocessing including normalization and one-hot encoding of labels
- Model training and evaluation on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualization of training performance through accuracy and loss plots

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nagaditya39/LeNet5-CIFAR10-Visualizer.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install numpy tensorflow tensorflow matplotlib
```

3. Modify the hyperparameters or model architecture in `train.py` according to your requirements, if needed.

## Results

After training the model, you can observe the training performance through accuracy and loss plots generated by the script. These plots provide insights into the model's convergence and performance on the training and validation datasets.
